# reddit-scraper
An application that scrapes Reddit for images using this [meme-api](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api). Built with React, Chakra UI, nano-id and framer-motion. 


## Architecture
These are the technologies I used to create this app.

 - React
 - Chakra UI
 - nano-id (alternative to uuid)
 - Framer Motion

## Features

 - Displays memes and images from different sections of Reddit
 - Search by Sub-Reddit
 - Light and Dark Mode

**Potential Future Features**

 - Info Widget
 - Better Height formatting on images

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me about the importance of clean, reusable code as I refactored and refined mistakes I've made in the past. Along with a look at class components which handle state differently but I believe it is nice to be able to understand both.
